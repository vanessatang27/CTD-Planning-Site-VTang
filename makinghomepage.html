    <title>Making My Homepage</title>
    <p>
      We created a few ideas of the homepage after creating our flowchart. We referenced a lot from other websites. We made wireframes to give the client an idea of the layout of the website and where the content goes.
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe1.png"/>
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe2.png"/>
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe3.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      We chose to use the third wireframe because we want the menu bar to stand out a bit more, because it is our call to action.

      After working with both Fireworks and Dreamweaver, I found the pros and cons for both programs. Below is a compare and contrast of the two ways of making the homepage.
      <h2>Dreamweaver Pros</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>CSS can easily be applied and many things are classified, making it very easy to change a lot of things at the same time. For example, if I don't like the font of a specific list, I can change the font of the whole list at the same time.</li>
        <li>The webpage can be made interactive much more easily. Dropdown menus can be made, while pages made my Firework do not really move.</li>
        <li>The components of a Dreamweaver webpage can be more easily changed because it is not a set image. Everything is added in, while in Fireworks, everything is in slices which are already set images.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Fireworks Pros</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Components can be moved more easily since the position is not absolute.</li>
