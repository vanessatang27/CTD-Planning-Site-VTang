      Project Description
    </h1>
      <p>
        Sumayya's father is the owner of a branded cosmetics and perfume company. He sells cosmetics and perfume to both retailers and individual customers. This company already has a website <a href="http://www.mizspa.com"> mizspa.com</a>, but he is not satisfied with his website.
        The problem is that his website seems untrustworthy and somewhat cheap, despite the legitimacy and price of the products. His website's FAQ are full of questions asking whether the website is real or a counterfeit.

      Research
    </h1>
      <p>
        The very main objective of this project is to make the website and company look trustworthy. The first step is to look at the homepages. To attain this, we will first refer to other well-known and trusted cosmetics and perfume companies. We will look to Sasa HK, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and more.

        On Wednesday December 17th, my group and I met with our clients- the owner and the coordinator of Sky On International Ltd. They are the leaders of Mizspa. Through this meeting, we learned a lot about the company and their website. We got a clear idea of the objectives, purpose, and audience. It is a little different from what we expected. These are some things we learned from the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mizspa's original website may have some changes, but what the client needs is a Mizspa.com.hk, which would be more suited for local Hong Kong customers. This new local website is different from the original in the sense that it <strong>stresses the benefits for local customers</strong>. The company also wants to <strong>highlight popular perfume and cosmetics choices of Hong Kong people</strong> so that customers could follow up with the trend.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        20 to 45 year-old females from Hong Kong
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
          e-commerce, to make it easier for women to shop for cosmetics online
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Show a high-end luxurious feel</li>
          <li>Have a hint of local flavor</li>
          <li>Show the cheaper prices for local customers</li>
          <li>Show the option for delivery pickup</li>
          <li>Show that the company has a free gift wrapping service</li>
          <li>Optimise for google and SEO use</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        When our client was talking about SEO, we all did not know what it meant. After the meeting, we tried to research what SEO meant. It turns out that SEO is an abbreviation for <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>. It is the process of getting traffic from search results on search engines. A way to describe the webpage on search listings is to use the meta description tag.
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        After finding the objectives and purpose, we came up with a few ideas of flow chart of the pages that we will have on our website.
      </p>
        <img src="./Flowcharts/Website_Flowchart2.png" width=/>
        <img src="./Flowcharts/Website_Flowchart.png"/>
      <p>
        We chose to use this flowchart because it is simple and does not require a lot of clicks at all to get to a target page. There are also enough pages for the client to reference from this demo to make their own site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then created a few ideas of the homepage. We referenced a lot from other websites. We made wireframes to give the client an idea of the layout of the website and where the content goes.

      </p>
