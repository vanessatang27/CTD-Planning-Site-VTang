    <title>Making My Homepage</title>
    <p>
      We created a few ideas of the homepage after creating our flowchart. We referenced a lot from other websites. We made wireframes to give the client an idea of the layout of the website and where the content goes.
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe1.png"/>
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe2.png"/>
      <img src="./Wireframes/Wireframe3.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      We chose to use the third wireframe because we want the menu bar to stand out a bit more, because it is our call to action.
